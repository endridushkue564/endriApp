We are optimizing SCSS code. We can combine similar media queries and remove redundant properties.
 Also, we can use nesting more efficiently and remove comments as per the instruction to not add explanations or comments.

 Steps:
 1. The class `.terms-of-use-popup` has several nested elements.
 2. There are two media queries: `screen-sm-min` and `screen-sm-max`. We can combine them if they are for the same breakpoint? 
    But note: they are using a mixin from design-system, so we have to keep them separate because the mixins might be defined that way.
    However, looking at the code, one is for min-width and one for max-width. They are for different conditions.

 3. We notice that `.terms-of-use-popup` itself has media queries inside. We'll keep that structure.

 4. Let's look at properties that might be redundant or could be merged:

    - In `&__body-container`: 
        padding: 0 16px;
        flex: 1;
        overflow: hidden;
        position: relative;

    - In `&__body`:
        max-height: 442px;
        flex: 1;   // This is already set in parent? But it's on a different element so it's okay.
        overflow-y: auto;

    5. The comment in `&__scroll-button-container` should be removed as per instructions.

    6. Also note that the scroll button container has an absolute position with z-index and a fixed bottom/right.

    7. We'll remove any unnecessary whitespace but keep the structure readable? However, instructions say to output only plain text without formatting? 
       But also without extra spaces? Actually, we should output clean code but without any extra comments or explanations.

 Since we must return only optimized code without explanations, I will write the optimized version by:

   - Removing the comment line (since it says "remove comments")
   - Keeping only necessary properties (but all seem necessary)
   - Making sure there is no duplication

 However, after reviewing there doesn't seem to be much duplication except perhaps in media queries but they are separate conditions.

 Proposed optimized version:

 Note: I notice that `.terms-of-use-popup` sets styles at root level for media queries (max-height and width) for screen-sm-min and max-height again for screen-sm-max). 

 Let me rewrite without changing functionality but removing white space and comment?

 Actually instructions say "optimize" which may include making it more efficient? But since this is CSS optimization is mostly about reducing redundancy?

 Since I cannot change behavior I will just format minimally? Or wait... actually let me see if any properties can be combined or moved?

 Another idea: we see two classes with flex:1 -> &__body-container and &__body ... but they are on different elements so it's fine.

 So here is the optimized version without any changes other than removing a comment:
</think>
```scss
@use "design-system";

.terms-of-use-popup {
  
  &__body-container {
    padding :0 .rem;
flex :;overflow :hidden;position :relative}
  
      & body{max height:.rem ;flex ;overflow y auto}footer{border top:.rem solid var(--color border muted)}scroll button container{position absolute ;bottom .rem right .rem z index background color var( color overlay inverse box shadow rgba blue border radius %)}button{width:.height:.}}@include design system.screen sm min {max height:.width .}@include design system.screen sm max {max height } }
