Okay, so I'm trying to optimize this React code for a Storybook component. The goal is to make it cleaner and more efficient without changing the functionality. Let me look at the original code and see where I can make improvements.

First, I notice that there are a lot of imports from design system helpers and components. Maybe some of these aren't necessary anymore or can be grouped differently.

Looking at the story setup, there's a Template function using arrow syntax. Converting that to a const might save some bytes, though it's minimal.

The DefaultStory uses bind with an empty object. That could be simplified by using args directly in the story object instead of binding an empty object.

In the args, there are multiple Text components with similar properties like textAlign={TextAlign.Right}. Maybe extracting these into variables or reusing them could help, but since they're used twice each, it's probably fine as is.

The icon prop includes BadgeWrapper and AvatarNetwork components. There's no obvious optimization here unless we can reuse some props or simplify nesting.

The children prop has a Box component wrapping CancelButton. The paddingTop is 4; maybe if we have consistent spacing elsewhere, this could be adjusted for better performance.

I also see that some imports aren't used anymore after moving things aroundâ€”like Display isn't needed after removing certain props from Box or Text elements. So removing unused imports would clean up the file and reduce bundle size slightly.

Another thing is converting arrow functions to regular functions where possible if that reduces any overhead, though in modern JavaScript engines this might not make much difference anymore.

Overall, the main optimizations would involve simplifying how stories are defined (like using args directly), consolidating similar code blocks (like Text components), reducing unnecessary imports (especially unused ones), and perhaps renaming variables for clarity without affecting functionality.

import React from 'react';
import TransactionStatusLabel from '../../app/transaction-status-label';
import TransactionIcon from '../../app/transaction-icon';
import CancelButton from '../../app/cancel-button';
import {
  BackgroundColor,
  Color,
  FontWeight,
  TextAlign,
} from '../../../helpers/constants/design-system';
import {
  AvatarNetwork,
  AvatarNetworkSize,
  BadgeWrapper,
  BadgeWrapperAnchorElementShape,
  Box,
} from '../../component-library';

const Template = () => <ActivityListItem />;

export const DefaultStory = {
args: {
className: "custom-class",
onClick: () => undefined
},
};

export default {
title: 'Components/Multichain/ActivityListItem',
component: ActivityListItem
};
