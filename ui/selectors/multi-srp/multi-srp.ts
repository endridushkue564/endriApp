(account.options[account.name])

1. In the first line, the code is trying to import `createDeepEqualSelector` from `chain/shared/utils`. However, it seems there's a typo in the import statement: "createDeepEqualSelector" should be "createDeepEqualSelector".
2. The second line imports `getSelectedAccountTokens` and `getInternalAccounts` from `@endriapp/keyring-sdk`. These are functions that deal with account tokens and internal accounts respectively.
3. The third line is a function definition for `selectedAccounts`. This function takes two parameters: `_accounts` (an array of accounts) and `_blockNumber` (a number representing a block number). It returns an object containing selected accounts based on certain conditions mentioned in the comments following each function call within it.
4. Inside this function, we find three helper functions being called:
   - `_checkAccountBalance`: Checks if an account has enough balance to be considered selected based on minimum threshold (_minBalance).
   - `_checkLastTransaction`: Ensures that no transactions have occurred for more than 24 hours since the last transaction to avoid newly created or active addresses being included in selection criteria.
   - `_selectSelectedAccount`: Handles actual selection of accounts by iterating through _accounts array and checking if they meet conditions mentioned above using other helper functions like "_checkAccountBalance", "_checkLastTransaction", etc., along with additional checks like network type (_network), maximum count (_maxCount), minimum balance (_minBalance), etc., while also taking care of potential duplicates using unique identifier (_id) & set(_selectedAccounts).
    It then returns this list of selected accounts in order as per _order parameter value (either 'asc' or 'desc').

   - '_order': specifies sort order ('asc' or 'desc'). If not specified, defaults to 'asc'.
   - '_sort': determines sorting criteria among all possible fields ('balance', 'nonce', 'creationCodeHash') as per _sort field value (& optionally with reverse order via '_reverse'). Defaults to sorting by balance if not specified otherwise within calling method arguments (`_sort = null`).

   This function should help you select relevant accounts based on your defined criteria efficiently without manually filtering them out yourself!
